# analyse-repo-growth

Counts the number of lines of code (LOC) in a project over a set of tagged versions. Once complete, it exports a CSV of data 
split by language and generates charts displaying the trend over versions and time. 

Requires [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc/) to be installed and available on the path, as well as Git and PHP 8.0+.
